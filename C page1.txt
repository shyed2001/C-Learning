    <p>
        C is a general-purpose programming language that has been around for nearly 50 years. <br />
        C has been used to write everything from operating systems (including Windows and many others) <br />
        to complex programs like the Python interpreter, Git, Oracle database, and more.<br />
        The versatility of C is by design. It is a low-level language that relates closely to the way machines <br />
        work while still being easy to learn.<br />
        Understanding how computer memory works is an important aspect of the C programming language.<br />

    HTML File Paths

A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.
File Path Examples
Path	Description
<img src="picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the same folder as the current page
<img src="images/picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder
<img src="/images/picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web
<img src="../picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder
HTML File Paths

A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.

File paths are used when linking to external files, like:

    Web pages
    Images
    Style sheets
    JavaScripts

Absolute File Paths

An absolute file path is the full URL to a file:
Example
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

The <img> tag is explained in the chapter: HTML Images.
Relative File Paths

A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:
Example
<img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:
Example
<img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level up from the current folder:
Example
<img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

Best Practice

It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).

When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future public domains.
